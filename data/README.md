# Hyperparameter Tuning: Dataset

This folder should contain the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview) dataset, consisting of 3 files:

- `train.csv`, renamed to `mnist.cvs`
- `test.csv`
- `sample_submission.csv`

All these files are not committed to the repository.
